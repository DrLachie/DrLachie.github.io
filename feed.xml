<p>When we first decided we needed a website, the first question was obviously: what should our logo be.</p>

<p>At first I wanted something quickly, and took the obvious route of paying homage (shamelessly plaigerising) the GloBIAS Logo:
<img src="/assets/images/globias_logo.png" alt="Globias Logo" height="200" /></p>

<p>In a fit of … what’s the opposite of creatitvity… I created this monstrosity: 
<img src="/assets/images/old_logo_DoNotUse.png" alt="Original Ausbias Logo" height="200" />
My thoughts were: 
    - change the colours to “Aussie it up a bit” 
    - highlight the bottom right, where we usually appear on a map of the world.</p>

<p>After all this, I decided it was best to actually ask permission from the GloBIAS organising committee and, while flattered, they were somewhat concerned about protecting their brand now that they’re a legal entity. This was entirely justified so back to the drawing board for me.</p>

<p>Next I looked at the Neubias logo: 
<img src="/assets/images/neubias_logo.png" alt="Neubias Logo" height="200" />
Well I liked the look of the network there, so that’s where I started tinkering.</p>

<p>First - I found a csv file with the latitude and longitude of the major cities in Australia, including their populations as well. Then wrote a script to put a population sized dot on each and connect them with lines.
<img src="../assets/images/straight_lines.png" alt="Australia with striaght lines connecting population centers" height="200" /></p>

<p>That was cool and all, but as I had scaled the Cities to the population, why not do the same with the lines?

<p>I still wasn’t happy so decided to curve the lines, and add a colour map: 
<img src="../assets/images/almost_final.png" alt="Almost there..." /></p>

<p>That was it. Thought to make it more abstract I’d remove the coastline, had a design-minded friend help chose a font and the rest is (extremely recent) history:</p>
